    "##### So far, we have been working with synthetic data that arrived in ready-made tensors. However, to apply deep learning in the wild we must extract messy data stored in arbitrary formats, and preprocess it to suit our needs. Fortunately, the pandas library can do much of the heavy lifting. This section, while no substitute for a proper pandas tutorial, will give you a crash course on some of the most common routines."
